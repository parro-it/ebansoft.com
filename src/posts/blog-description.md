The size levels used in various context are: 

1) used for headers `h1` and `h2` (they greatly differs by having a different `font-family`). The [header of this chapter](#Typography) is an example of
an `h2` header, which uses the "Averia Serif Libre" font.
The title of the page is an `h1` header, using a "Cinzel Decorative" font.

2) used for headers `h3`
3) used for headers `h4`, `h5`, `h6`. 
4) used for normal body text (such has this one). This size
correspond to 1em, is set by default to 21px, and varies according 
to page media size.
5) used as small text, such as for `table` ot `figure` captions.

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
