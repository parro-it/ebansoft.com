Something like 23 years ago I was starting to learn
to use and write components using Visual Basic 6.

Since them, I was fascinated by the concept of components,
and so I start to write my collection of libraries.

Soon, I start to be frustrated by the limitations of
the tools I was using.

Maintaining a collection of independent libraries,
and managing dependencies upgrades and compatibility
was a nightmare. The situation slightly improve with Dot.NET,
but still...

It was when I discovered Node.js and NPM that I finally find
I have the right tools to build a really useful collection
of packages.

## The current situation üè≠

But in 2020, I want to be able to use es6 modules
and typescript type descriptions:

```js
import {map} from "map";

console.log(map("ciao", toUpper))
```

So I wrote the first module of the collection, and here we are

| Name   | Description       |
| ----   | ----------------- |
| map    | map function      |
| filter | filter function   |
| slice  | map function      |
